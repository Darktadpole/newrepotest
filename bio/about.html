<p>After human players gotten beat by Alphago and Deep Blue, more and more people are starting worry about the risk  of their job being replaced by robots in the near future. Should the web developers, one of robot ‘s  soul-giver have the same concern as well?  My answer will be “no”. Some people could think that web developers are just a bunch of nerds know nothing but the lifeless code. But the truth is web developer  is a job require not only code mastering but also creativity, a complicate mix up of technical skill and imagination which AI could hard to comprehend and compatible.</p>
<p>Techniques and imagination is actually two of my strengths. I am a man hungry for knowledge. I always stay curious with all the technology things. So far I have been self-learn the Microsoft word, Excel, Powerpoint, Photoshop, Illustrator,  Indesign, Dreamweaver and basic Blender 3d. I am also interest in medical,  gardening, garment sewing and writing fantasy fiction in Chinese. Since fiction writing require abundant imagination,  so one of my hobby is search all kind of information from different field to enhance my creativity. My another hobby is to create something innovative, I really enjoy the process of creating something new. And I turn these hobbies to my advantage, and they will be the greatest push for my study and work progress.</p>
<p>I believe every working experience is a piece of stepping stone lead me to success, no matter it get paid or not. I had working experience in pharmacy, garment factory and printing company which enrich my knowledge of medical, garment sewing and photo designing. I also worked in hospital and college library as a volunteer while I was a student in college, and it really enhance my skill in team collaboration.</p>
 <p>I hope I can have opportunity to gain more working experience to make my knowledge to another level.</p>
